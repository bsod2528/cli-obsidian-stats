My version of git is a simple tool created to:
- track
- handle
- visualise

all the changes made. This was initially named as `cli-obsidian-tools`, but as I wanted to make something bigger and better, this has become an internal tool that runs like GIT but very different in terms of use-case.

I love data, so this is entirely for me to see what I do.

More on the tool later on as I have a grip of exactly what I'm doing.
